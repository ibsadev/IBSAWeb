## About
IBSAWeb is a team of Indonesian students, domestic and abroad, working together to create a community for Indonesian students here at UCLA. We understand the struggle of international students coming to the United States from Indonesia and we want to welcome them with open arms. We are hoping to create a community of understanding and nurturing to further help students succeed in whatever their career goals are after college. 

Our hope with this website is to help promote that community further and create a bond of understanding and friendship with your fellow Indonesian students. This website will be exclusively for club members, for them to keep up to date with our meetings, and for them to get classes with one another. 

This website is entirely free and sponsored by IBSA. You will get to network with UCLA Alumni, current students, and even incoming students. Why not give it a try?
