One Time Scripts
================

Files
-----
##### GetData.py: Gets all classes based on UCLA course descriptions website
##### classes.json: GetData.py will store here
##### sendData.js: sends data through JavaScript (Could be done via Python but I wanted the practice)

Usage
-----
##### Just run the python3 GetData.py to get the class data, follow up by running sendData.js. No singular command will be provided to ensure no one that doesn't understand basic coding can run this and break something in the database. Please adjust connections in sendData.js only. All variables in Python script should remain the same unless UCLA changes DNS hosts.
